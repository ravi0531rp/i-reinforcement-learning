## Reinforcement Learning Examples

* Here, in this repository, I will try to solve some predefined and some custom environments using both model-free as well as model-based algorithms.

* More to follow.

* Basics
1) Always look out for average rewards & average episode time
2) Some envs don't have a fixed episode length(infinite world)
